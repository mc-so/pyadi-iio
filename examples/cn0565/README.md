## 1. Install prerequisites:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## 2. Run Bio Impedance measurements:
```
python3 query -h
```
This will display the help file
Examples:
Run Bio Impedance measurements on given electrodes:
```
python3 query.py -p com5 -z -e 0 3 1 2
```
In case the firmware is running an iio server:
```
python3 query.py -p com5 -b 230400 -z -e 0 3 1 2 --iio
```
This will Use Electrodes 0 and 3 for excitation ans electrodes 1 and 2 for sensing. -z tells the software to query impedance. Without -z, it will do voltage measurements.


## 3. To run the GUI:
```
python3 main.py -e 16
```
In case the firmware is running an iio server:
```
python3 main.py -b 230400 -e 16 --iio
```
This will start the GUI for the EIT. The GUI is currently a work in progress so there are a lot of know bugs which I will be fixing later.
